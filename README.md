# Introduction
Welcome to our GitHub repository for DBA! 
This GitHub repository has been created for easy communication of codes with likeminded researchers who wish to simulate standard errors of any target TPP hazard ratios from a anchor study checklist early on the health technology lifecycle.
This repository comprises the reproducible R code and parameters of the fitted models for OS and PFS for all the 37 HR scenarios between (0.1 to 1.00 by-step = 0.025) mentioned in the accompanying paper. Below we have mentioned the each of the files and pre-requisites and any special notes or comments that we may have. Again we note, the target product profile (TPP) for our illustrative example is for wonderumab versus sunitinib for determining value-based thresholds. 

# Choosing the Anchor Study
For any time-to-event be it OS or PFS, the anchor study from the baseline risk is adjusted for the TPP study (novel HT) is followed as per the steps mentioned in the accompanying paper by Dutta Majumdar et al.
After the scoring, in our case, for both OS and PFS, [Checkmate-214 Motzer et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35383908/) was selected as best suitable for modeling sunitinib's baseline risk.
